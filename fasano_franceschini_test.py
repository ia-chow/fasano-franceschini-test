    Computes the 2-sample Fasano-Franceschini test, a multivariate generalization of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as outlined by Fasano & Franceschini (1987). The test evaluates the null hypothesis H0 that two i.i.d. random samples are drawn from the same underlying probability distribution. Although Fasano & Franceschini's original paper only evaluates two- and three-dimensional data, the test can be extended to arbitrary dimensions.

    :return: a tuple of the following values:

    float statistic: The value of the test statistic, Dn
